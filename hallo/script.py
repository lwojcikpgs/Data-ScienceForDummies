pi = 3.14159 # approximate
diameter = 3

# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
radius = diameter / 2

# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
area = pi * math.pow(radius, 2)
print(lol("1", 2), lol("2", 3) ,lol("3", 4), area)
